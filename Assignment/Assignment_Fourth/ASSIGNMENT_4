1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.
ans. Legibility refers to how easily individual letters and characters can be distinguished and recognized from one another, focusing on the clarity of typeface design, letter forms, and contrast.Readability refers to how easily and comfortably a block of text can be read and understood as a whole, depending on factors like font choice, line spacing, line length, layout, and text organization.

2. What is the ”Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
ans. The Rule of Thirds is a design principle that divides a layout into a 3×3 grid using two horizontal and two vertical lines. It suggests placing key elements at the intersections or along these lines to create balanced, visually appealing compositions. This technique helps guide the viewer’s eye and enhances the overall aesthetic of a design.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?
ans. You should limit the number of font families used on a website to maintain visual consistency and improve readability. Using too many fonts can create a cluttered, unprofessional appearance and confuse users. A consistent typographic style enhances brand identity and ensures a clean, cohesive user experience.

4. Define ”Responsive Web Design.”
ans. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that ensures websites adapt and display optimally across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It uses flexible layouts, scalable images, and CSS media queries to dynamically adjust the content and layout based on the user's device, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience regardless of the screen size.

5. Explain the ”F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a
web page.

ans. The F-Pattern of scanning refers to the way users typically read content on a web page, resembling the shape of the letter "F". This pattern was identified through eye-tracking studies and shows that users first scan horizontally across the top of the page, then move down to scan a second horizontal section, and finally scan vertically down the left side of the page.

This behavior influences content placement by emphasizing that important information should be placed in the top-left area of the page, as this is where users’ eyes naturally focus first. Key elements such as headlines, navigation menus, and primary calls-to-action should be positioned within the top horizontal band to capture attention. Secondary content can be placed below, but it's crucial to maintain a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the F-shaped reading pattern.

By aligning content with the F-Pattern, designers can ensure that users quickly find the most relevant information, improving usability and engagement. For example, placing the main navigation and primary content in the top-left corner aligns with natural reading habits, while less critical information can be positioned further down or to the right.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of where Blue,Red, and Green should be used.

ans. Colors in web design have a significant psychological impact, influencing user emotions, perceptions, and behaviors. Blue is associated with trust, calmness, and professionalism, making it ideal for financial institutions, healthcare websites, or corporate platforms (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn). Red evokes urgency, excitement, and passion, often used for calls-to-action, sale promotions, or warning messages (e.g., "Buy Now" buttons or error alerts). Green symbolizes nature, growth, and safety, making it suitable for eco-friendly brands, health-related sites, or financial tools emphasizing security and sustainability (e.g., environmental organizations or wellness apps). Using these colors strategically can enhance user engagement and reinforce brand messaging.

7. Explain the ”60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.

ans. The 60-30-10 Rule is a color composition guideline used in web design to create visually balanced and harmonious layouts. It suggests allocating colors as follows:

i. 60% of the design should use a dominant color (typically the primary background or main theme), which establishes the overall mood and sets the tone.

ii. 30% should be a secondary color (often used for accents, navigation, or key elements), providing contrast and structure.

iii. 10% should be an accent color (used for highlights, buttons, or interactive elements), drawing attention to important features.

This ratio ensures visual harmony and prevents overwhelming the user with too many colors. For example, a website might use 60% blue as the background, 30% white or light gray for content areas, and 10% red for call-to-action buttons. By following this rule, designers can create a clean, professional look that enhances readability and user experience.
