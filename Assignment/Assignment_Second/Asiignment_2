Chapter 2 : Website Development process

Group A:
1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
ans. THe term "Sitemap " is a file where you provide information about the pages, 
videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search 
engines like google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently.

2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
ans. The prupose of launch phase in web development is to stratitegically
 deploy the finished website from a private staging environment to the live,
 public internet, making it accessible to users, while ensuring everything is optimized, secure, and ready for performance monitoring, acting as the crucial bridge from development to a live digital phase.

3. Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
ans. Documentation is important in the development lifectycle becuase it acts as a bridge between team members, 
ensurung everyone is on the same page.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
ans. Difference between Front-end and back-end development is that Front-end development builds user-facing parts 
of website using html, css JavaScript where user sees ans touches or  interacts whereas Back-end development builds 
hidden logic, databases, and infrastructures that poer the front-end, using languages like python, Java, Php etc.


Group B: 

5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discus this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
ans. Planning is the most critical phase of web developmenet because it the essentail
 groundwork or foundation for all subsequent activities, hwlping to align the final 
 product with the project goals and business objectives. A well-executed planning phase 
 mitigates common risks like scope creep, budget overruns and mis alignment of exceptation. 

The key Activities performed during the plannign phase: 
1. Sitemap creation:
Developing a sitemap that outlines the main pages of the website and
 provides a visual representation of the overall structure.

2. Wireframes: 
Creating sketches of page layouts to show the placement of images, buttons, menus, and other design elements.

3.  Selecting Technologies: 
Choosing appropriate technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React 
for the frontend; Node.js, PHP, or Django for the backend; and MySQL or MongoDB for the database

4. Content Strategy:
Planning where each type of content will be placed across the website to ensure clarity and consistency.

5. SEO Strategy
Defining keywords, meta tags, URL structures, and ensuring mobile-friendliness to optimize search engine visibility.

6. Resource Allocation:
Assigning tasks to designers, developers, and content writers to streamline workflow and collaboration

7. Timeline & Milestones:
- Establishing deadlines for each stage of the project and setting milestones to track progress effectively.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
ans. Iterative nature of the maintenance phase is a continious loop of monitoring, updating, fixing, and 
improving a website after it goes live. Ones a website is developed developers refularly patches bugs, update 
contents, improve performance, fix security issues, and adjust features based on user feedback and analytics. 
Each change can create new requirements, whic sends you right back into another mini-cycle od analysis, design, and 
implementations. A website exists in a constantly changing environments. User exceptations ecolve, tecjnologies update, 
browser changes, security threats appear, and business goals shift. What worked last work will be outdated in future. 
So, a website is never truly finished until it doesnt get any funds.

7.  Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
ans. Information Gathering is the first step in web development where requirements are collected before any design or 
coding begins. It involves identifying the purpose of the website, business goals, type of content, required features,
technical constraints, budget, and timeline.This step includes client discussions, competitor analysis, user research,
and studying existing systems. The goal is to clearly define what the website should do and why it exists, so later stages
don’t turn into chaos disguised as creativity.
The website is built for users, not for the developer’s ego. Knowing the target audience helps determine design style, content
tone, navigation structure, accessibility needs, and functionality. Different users have different expectations, technical
skills, and behaviors. If the audience isn’t understood, the website may look impressive but fail to be usable, relevant, or 
effective. In short, without audience understanding, you risk solving the wrong problem very efficiently.

Group C:

8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the
”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

ans. As a project manger for the new e-commerce site, I strongly advise against skipping the testing phase, despite the desire to save money and launch early. Testing is a critical component of the web development process that ensures the website functions as intended, is secure, and provides a seamless user experience across different devices and browsers.
Skipping the testing phase can lead to several significant risks:
such as: Security risks ,functionality risks and compatibility risks.
1. Security Risks: 
   Security risks become extremely high without testing. An e-commerce site handles sensitive data such as customer details, passwords, and payment information. Without proper testing, vulnerabilities like SQL injection, weak authentication, or insecure payment processing can go unnoticed. A single security breach can lead to financial loss, legal consequences, and permanent damage to the company’s reputation. Fixing security issues after launch is also far more expensive than preventing them early.

2. Functionality Risks:
    Functionality risks are another major concern. Without thorough testing, there is a high likelihood of bugs and errors that can disrupt the user experience. Issues such as broken links, incorrect form submissions, or missing features can all occur without proper testing. These problems not only frustrate users but also impact the credibility and usability of the site. Testing ensures that core features like product search, shopping cart, checkout, and payment gateways work correctly. If these are not tested, users may experience errors such as failed payments, incorrect order totals, or lost orders. Customers will not “wait for a patch” on an e-commerce site. They will leave and buy from a competitor.

3. Compatibility Risks:
    Compatibility risks arise when a website does not function properly across different browsers, devices, and operating systems. Without testing across different browsers, devices, and screen sizes, the website may work on one system but fail on others. For example, the site might function on a desktop but break on mobile, where most users shop. This directly reduces sales and damages brand trust.

9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled?

ans. Firstly, the developer made a error by skipping the crucial planning steps of creating a design prototype and sitemap before starting the coding process. This oversight led to a misalignment between the developer's vision and the client's expectations, resulting in the client rejecting the layout midway through the project.
     Those assumptions turned into hard-coded decisions before the client had a chance to visualize or approve anything. When the client finally saw the site, it did not match their expectations, so rejection was inevitable.

     Then, there were no reequiremnt validation. The developer should have engaged in a thorough requirements gathering phase to understand the client's needs, preferences, and business goals. This would have provided a clear direction for the design and functionality of the website.
     The developer thought they understood the requirements; the client thought something completely different. This gap caused wasted time and rework.

     Atlast, the process lacked early feedback and sign-off. Prototypes exist for one main reason: to get approval before expensive development starts. Skipping this step meant feedback arrived late, when changes were costly and frustrating for both sides.

     How it should have been handled is straightforward. The developer should have started with information gathering, followed by creating a sitemap to define structure and a wireframe or design prototype to show layout and user flow. The client should then review and formally approve these before coding begins. Only after design sign-off should development start. This approach ensures alignment, reduces rework, and leads to a smoother development process with a final product that meets client expectations.

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.

ans. The students neglected the maintenance phase of the development lifecycle. The maintenance phase is crucial for ensuring that a website remains relevant, functional, and up-to-date after its initial launch. Neglecting this phase can lead to outdated information, security vulnerabilities, and a poor user experience, as seen in the case of the university website where students stopped visiting due to outdated exam schedules.
     The activities involved in the maintenance phase include:
     1. Content Updates: Regularly updating the website's content to ensure that information such as exam schedules, course offerings, and news is current and accurate.
     2. Bug Fixes: Identifying and resolving any technical issues or bugs that arise to ensure the website functions smoothly.
     3. Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitoring the website's performance to ensure fast load times and optimal user experience.
     4. Security Updates: Implementing security patches and updates to protect the website from vulnerabilities and cyber threats.
     5. User Feedback: Collecting and analyzing user feedback to make improvements and address any
